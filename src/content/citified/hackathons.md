### [WorCare | Best Hacks 2023, 2nd Prize](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/jakub-ner-131714187_during-best-hacks-2023-my-team-for-the-activity-7126364575158927360-0yRC?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop)

We developed [WorCare](https://worcare.my.canva.site/), a healthcare app for employers that incentivizes employees to
prioritize their health by rewarding
them with gift cards and other rewards. The app also provides anonymized data for HR to monitor overall employee
well-being efficiently. This innovation earned us 2nd prize in the Best Hacks 2023.
