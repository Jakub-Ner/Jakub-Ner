I've been involved in a variety of projects, ranging from hackathons to personal or university projects. Sometimes the
goal was to try out new technologies,
challenge myself, simply have fun or all together.

## Machine Learning

### [Path Searching algorithms](https://github.com/Jakub-Ner/Sztuczna-inteligencja/tree/main/ZAD1%20Rozwi%C4%85zywanie%20problem%C3%B3w%20przez%20przeszukiwanie)

This project compares pathfinding algorithms for public transport routes (MPK) using **Python**. It focuses on using
Dijkstra and A* to
find the best connection between two stations and explores the Tabu algorithm for the optimal route through multiple
stations.

### [Minimax](https://github.com/Jakub-Ner/Sztuczna-inteligencja/tree/main/ZAD2%20MinMax)

This project compares various implementations of the minimax algorithm in **GoLang**, including recursive, concurrent,
and
alpha-beta pruning versions. It also analyzes different heuristics and parameters. The algorithm is demonstrated using
Halma, a Chinese checkers variant where the goal is to reach the opponent's base first.

### [EEG classifier](https://github.com/PipelonDevs/EEG_Datasets/tree/main/Classifier)

This project involves a pipeline that processes EEG experiment data. It lazy loads the data, preprocesses it, splits it
into 1-second intervals, shuffles the data, and then uses it to create mental state classifiers with **PyTorch**.

### [Brain waves analysis](https://github.com/Jakub-Ner/EEG-Feature-Analysis)

This project uses **R** to analyze EEG data
from ["a study on mental state classification"](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8710576), covering relaxed,
neutral, and
concentrating states. It includes artifact removal (bandpass and notch filters), feature selection with PSD, and
baseline signal extraction.

## Web & Mobile

### [Interactive Map of Bieruń](/citified/interactive-bierun-map)

Following Citified win at Hack The Climate 2023, my team delivered the interactive map of Bieruń within 7 months. As the
lead
software engineer, I managed the entire technical process: designing the backend in **Nest.js**, DevOps tasks like
configuring nginx
and orchestrating containerized services, and frontend **React.js** implementation including map functionalities, SEO
enhancements and prerendering with **Node.js**.
Additionally, I handled client communication and requirements gathering.

### [WorCare](/citified/hackathons/#worcare--best-hacks-2023-2nd-prize)

I contributed to developing WorCare, a healthcare app for employers. My role focused on building the **Next.js**
frontend
and backend with **MongoDB**. Additionally, I uniquely pitched our idea by
incorporating [Jan Kochanowski's "To Health"](https://www.babelmatrix.org/works/pl/Kochanowski,_Jan/Na_zdrowie/en/5245-To_Health)
trifle. Our innovation earned 2nd prize in the Best Hacks 2023.

### [VoiceMess](https://github.com/Jakub-Ner/VoiceMess)

A mobile app designed to read SMS messages aloud using a customized voice generated by ElevenLabs' cutting-edge cloning
service. Developed with **Expo (React Native)**, it utilizes my [Expo's SMS module](#expo-sms), crafted specifically for
this project, to
listen to incoming SMS (Android-only). User authentication is integrated through Facebook SSO.

### [MackawAI](https://github.com/orgs/Macaw-AI/repositories)

A **React-Native** app designed to help users learn to speak foreign languages, powered by Google TTS,
Speech-to-Text, and GPT-3, even before it became trendy. For the backend, we utilized **Firebase**.

### [Expo SMS](https://github.com/Jakub-Ner/expo-sms-module)

A Kotlin module for sending and receiving SMS messages with bindings in JavaScript, designed to work seamlessly as an
Expo module.

### [Android projects](https://github.com/Jakub-Ner/android-projects)

A collection of Android projects where I explored various Android development concepts, including Fragments, Activities,
Layouts, Navigation, Drawers, and the Jetpack Compose Toolkit.

### [History Compass](https://worcare.my.canva.site/kompas-historii)

We developed History Compass, a React-Native app that uses an API to provide information about monuments. The app shows
the nearest monuments and redirects users to detailed pages for more information, comments, or saving for later. The
challenge was addressing the lack of comprehensive records, fading memories, and the tendency to associate sightseeing
only with travel. Our solution encourages exploration, engages the community, and brings information about Polish
heritage
closer to the public.

### [Questapp](/pipelon/hackathons/#questappka--hackyeah-2023-finalist)

**React.js** platform with **Flask** backend.

------------------------------------------------

## C#

### [Bore No More](/pipelon/bore-no-more)

[Pipelon](/pipelon) the biggest project, and also our bachelor thesis, that focuses on creating a C# framework for seamless BCI
integration, that facilitates device connection, EEG signal classification, callbacks invocation and **Unity** integration.

### [Tetris BCI Experiment](https://github.com/PipelonDevs/tetris-bore-no-more)
Self-contained experiment that enables easy EEG data collection and annotations. Created as part of the [Bore No More](/pipelon/bore-no-more) project

### [TowerDefense](https://github.com/PipelonDevs/TowerDefence)
**Unity** PoC, enhanced by dialogues written with [Ink language](https://www.inklestudios.com/ink/).


------------------------------------------------

## Others

### [EEG-collector](https://github.com/PipelonDevs/EEG-Collector)

EEG-collector is a **Python** application designed to simplify the collection, visualization, and annotation of EEG
data. Built with Tkinter and Matplotlib, this simple GUI facilitates EEG data collection while adhering to format
standards and storing annotations in JSON.

### [NoteScribe](/pipelon/hackathons/#notescribe--hack4wroclawtech-2023-3rd-place)

Note Scribe is an **Python** application for scribing notes from documents and articles using LLM technology. It
leverages
LangChain for document splitting, chaining and templating prompts, MenuAgent implementation, and semantic similarity
searching. Embeddings and LLM (OpenAI) handle decision-making, summaries, QA, and note creation. Chroma is used for
storing documents as embeddings, Tesseract for extracting text from images or unselectable PDFs, and Eleven Labs for
converting notes into high-quality, natural-sounding podcasts.

### [Dummy-Generator](https://github.com/Jakub-Ner/Dummy-Generator)

This project automates the tedious task of manually entering large amounts of data into MS Access. Using the Faker
**Python** library, I created a data generator that streamlines this process, saving time and reducing the monotony for
my
university peers.

### [Auto-meetings](https://github.com/Jakub-Ner/Auto-meetings)

A tool that ensures you never miss meetings by managing your schedule and waking your PC before each meeting. Written in
**Python**, **HTML**, **CSS**, **Shell**. It features a WebUI where you can view upcoming meetings and even check your
GMail mailbox for new ones. The app runs as a lightweight **systemd** service, allowing you to hibernate your PC and
have it wake up automatically to record meetings or check for updates. Installation requires basic terminal commands,
and the app is
free and open-source.
