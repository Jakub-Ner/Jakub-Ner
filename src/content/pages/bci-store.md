BCI Store is committed to transforming the BCI landscape by making technology more accessible, collaborative, and future-ready.


## Difficulties in the Brain-Computer Interface Industry
The Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) industry faces several significant challenges:

- **Lack of brand-independent software**: Despite BCIs working similarly at a high level, existing software is tied to specific brands. The main physical differences between BCIs include:
  - **Data transmission methods**: UDP, WebSocket, etc.
  - **Channel location and number**: (See diagram: `eeg-channels-diagram.png`)
  - **Types of data**: Raw EEG, preprocessed frequency bands, or classifications like emotional states (e.g., boredom, shown in `valence-arousal-plot.png`).
