## Why BCI Store?

Imagine a world where you can control your environment or gain meaningful insights into your emotions and thoughts—all using the power of your mind. Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs) are transforming this vision into a reality. However, despite the technological advancements, the industry remains fragmented and restrained by various obstacles. **BCI Store** aims to address these challenges and accelerate the development and adoption of BCIs.

### The Problem

While BCIs have become sleeker, more affordable, and increasingly accessible—with some devices priced under $200—their full potential is limited. The industry struggles with:

- **Brand-Dependent Software**: BCIs largely function similarly across the board. Yet, the software ecosystems are locked to specific brands, stifling cross-platform innovation.
- **Differences**: BCI devices may vary in: 
    - **Channel Locations**: Varying number of channels and their locations across devices.
    - **Transmitting protocols**: Different methods of data transmission, such as UDP or WebSocket.
    - **Type of data**: Different types of data, such as raw EEG data, processed frequency bands, or mental states.

**BCI Store** seeks to overcome these hurdles to create a thriving, innovative ecosystem.

## What is BCI Store?

BCI Store is an open-source hosting platform designed to break down the barriers in the BCI industry. My solution includes:
1. **Device Configuration Management**: Users can access and maintain the latest configurations for various BCI devices. My system maps and clusters channel locations and selects the most suitable states and classifiers, simplifying integration.
2. **Classifier Storage and Access**: Developers and researchers can store classifiers, either publicly or privately, and associate them with specific devices. This improves resource sharing and collaboration.
3. **Research Tools and Analytics**: My platform offers integrated surveys and analytics, making it easier to conduct studies and understand user interactions.
4. **BCI Mocks for Development**: I provide mock BCI setups to streamline the testing process for developers, reducing time and resources needed for innovation.

## How I Make This Happen

BCI Store is built on a vision of **open collaboration** and **industry growth**. My approach includes:

### 1. **Open-Source Framework**
My team is currently developing a flexible, open-source foundation that unifies how BCIs interact with software. This enables seamless app development across devices, reducing brand dependency and encouraging more creative applications. [Visit official website](https://borenomore.github.io/BoreNoMore/)

### 2. **Hosting Platform**
The platform is designed to accelerate innovation and simplify development. By acting as a repository and exchange point for classifiers and device configurations, the Hosting Platform reduces redundant efforts and encourages collaboration. It ensures that end users and developers have quick access to high-quality, ready-to-use resources, making the most of their BCI investments.

### 3. **Market Collaboration**
To build trust, I will initially partner with biofeedback therapists, especially in educational settings. By working with schools, I can educate children and parents on the benefits of BCIs, raising awareness and establishing credibility.

### 4. **Hackathons and Community Engagement**
I will organize BCI hackathons to inspire and engage developers and researchers. These events will foster innovation, attract attention to the field, and showcase the potential of a unified BCI platform.

### 5. **Incentives for Adoption**
To lower entry barriers, BCI Store will offer device rentals with a trial period. This incentivizes new users and provides support to BCI companies, encouraging exploration and experimentation without upfront commitment.

## The Impact of BCI Store

My platform will create a ripple effect of benefits across the industry:

- **Enhanced Value for BCI Owners**: By making more software accessible, BCI Store increases the utility of owning a BCI device, providing users with a wide array of applications.
- **Accelerated Innovation**: An open and collaborative research environment helps solve common issues, such as noise reduction and data quality during movement, more efficiently.
- **Simplified Development**: By unifying software development processes for different devices, BCI Store reduces the complexity and cost associated with app creation. Developers can focus on innovation instead of struggling with compatibility issues.
